# SuroiFi Technical Architecture

## Overview
SuroiFi is a blockchain-based battle royale game that combines NFT integration with real-time gameplay.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React + Vite for UI development
- Web3.js for blockchain interactions
- Three.js for game rendering
- Socket.io-client for real-time communication

### Backend
- Node.js + Express for API server
- MongoDB for game state and user data
- Socket.io for real-time game events
- Redis for caching and session management

### Blockchain
- Solana for NFT minting and transactions
- Metaplex for NFT metadata management

## System Components

### Game Engine
- Real-time player state management
- Physics calculations
- Collision detection
- Map generation

### NFT System
- Minting mechanism
- Marketplace integration
- NFT attributes and power-ups

### User Management
- Wallet integration
- Profile management
- Statistics tracking
- Achievement system

## Data Flow
1. User connects wallet
2. Backend validates user and loads profile
3. Game instance created/joined
4. Real-time game state updates via WebSocket
5. Blockchain transactions for NFT operations

## Security Considerations
- Server-side validation for all game actions
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure wallet connections
- Anti-cheat mechanisms

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for game servers
- Database sharding for user data
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Load balancing for API requests
