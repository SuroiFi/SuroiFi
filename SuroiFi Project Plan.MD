SuroiFi Project Plan
Introduction
The rapid advancement of blockchain technology is reshaping the future of digital entertainment, with blockchain gaming (GameFi) emerging as a pivotal application within the WEB3 ecosystem. By leveraging decentralization, player asset ownership, and economic incentives, GameFi is revolutionizing the traditional gaming industry. According to DappRadar, the global blockchain gaming market surpassed $10 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to $15 billion by 2025 (DappRadar, 2024). Against this backdrop, the SuroiFi project aims to transform the open-source 2D battle royale game Suroi into a blockchain-based game, integrating Solana blockchain technology, issuing the native token Suroi (SUR), and launching 100% of the token supply via the PUMP.fun platform.
Suroi is an open-source 2D battle royale game where players collect weapons, gear, and supplies on a dynamically generated map, competing against others in a shrinking toxic zone to become the last survivor. Renowned for its fast-paced gameplay, strategic depth, and community-driven development, Suroi has attracted a dedicated player base. SuroiFi will preserve Suroi’s core mechanics while introducing NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), a token economy, and decentralized governance (DAO) to provide players with true asset ownership and economic rewards, creating a sustainable gaming ecosystem.
SuroiFi’s vision is to become a leading GameFi project within the Solana ecosystem, combining the thrill of battle royale gaming with WEB3’s innovative mechanisms to deliver a unique experience for global players. This plan outlines SuroiFi’s background, development strategy, token economics, marketing approach, and risk management, serving as a comprehensive guide for investors, developers, and players.

Project Overview
Project Background
Suroi is an open-source 2D battle royale game developed by HasangerGames, accessible via web browsers for free. Its intuitive interface, fast-paced combat, and diverse weapon systems have garnered a loyal player base. The game supports solo and duo modes, requiring players to gather resources on a dynamic map, navigate a shrinking toxic zone, and combine strategy with skill.
SuroiFi aims to elevate Suroi into a blockchain game by integrating Solana blockchain technology and issuing the Suroi (SUR) token, with 100% of the token supply launched through the PUMP.fun platform. Solana’s high throughput (thousands of transactions per second) and low fees (approximately 0.00025 SOL per transaction) make it an ideal choice for GameFi development (Solana, 2025). PUMP.fun, a prominent token launch platform in the Solana ecosystem, has facilitated over 6 million token projects by May 2025, providing SuroiFi with a rapid deployment opportunity (PUMP.fun Data, 2025).
Core Vision and Objectives
SuroiFi’s vision is to create a GameFi ecosystem that blends the excitement of battle royale gaming with WEB3 innovation, delivering the following value propositions:
Asset Ownership: Empower players with true ownership of in-game assets (e.g., skins, weapons) via NFTs.
Economic Incentives: Enable players to earn SUR tokens through Play-to-Earn mechanics.
Community-Driven Governance: Foster player participation in game decisions via a DAO, enhancing engagement.
Sustainable Ecosystem: Maintain long-term token economic stability through a buyback-and-burn mechanism.
Specific objectives include:
Q2 2025: Launch SUR token, integrate basic NFT functionality, and initiate community building.
Q4 2025: Release SuroiFi’s first version, host global tournaments, and attract players and investors.
2026 and Beyond: Implement DAO governance, explore cross-chain compatibility, and expand game features.

The Sandbox, with its user-generated content (UGC) and virtual land trading, achieved a $1 billion market cap (CoinGecko, 2024). SuroiFi will leverage these insights, capitalizing on the broad appeal of battle royale games to carve a unique niche.
Game Design and Mechanics
Suroi Core Gameplay
Suroi is a fast-paced 2D battle royale game where players compete for survival on a dynamically generated map. Core mechanics include:
Resource Collection: Players start empty-handed, scavenging maps, breaking crates, or exploring buildings to acquire weapons, ammo, and medkits.
Toxic Zone Mechanism: The map periodically shrinks, with a toxic zone forcing players into smaller safe areas, intensifying combat.
Diverse Equipment: Offers a variety of weapons (e.g., rifles, pistols) and gear (e.g., armor, backpacks) to support different playstyles.
Team Mode: Supports solo or 2-player team modes, emphasizing cooperation and strategy.
With its vibrant visuals and engaging sound design, Suroi is ideal for quick, multi-round sessions, averaging 5-10 minutes per match. These attributes make it a strong foundation for blockchain integration.
SuroiFi Blockchain Integration
SuroiFi will incorporate the following WEB3 features via Solana:
NFT System: Create NFTs for in-game items (e.g., unique skins, weapons, characters), enabling ownership, trading, or display.
Token Economy: Use SUR tokens for in-game purchases, tournament entry fees, staking rewards, and governance voting.
Play-to-Earn Mechanics: Players earn SUR tokens by completing tasks, winning matches, or participating in events.
Decentralized Marketplace: Enable players to trade NFTs and SUR tokens on the SuroiFi platform.
DAO Governance: Allow SUR holders to vote on game updates, event planning, or economic adjustments via a DAO.
These features draw inspiration from Axie Infinity’s NFT pet system and Decentraland’s DAO governance, aiming to boost player engagement and economic incentives (DappRadar, 2024; Decentraland, 2024).
New Features and Upgrades
SuroiFi will introduce the following enhancements:
NFT Skins and Weapons: Players can own unique NFT skins and weapons, such as “Blazing Axe” or “Stellar Camoufl “‘Stellar Camouflage”’, tradable in-game or on marketplaces.
Tournament System: Host regular global tournaments where players pay SUR as entry fees, with winners earning substantial SUR or rare NFTs.
Social Features: Add friend lists, chat systems, and guild functionality to enhance player interaction.
Cross-Platform Support: Optimize for mobile (iOS and Android) to broaden the audience.
Dynamic Events: Introduce limited-time events, such as “Zombie Invasion” mode, to diversify gameplay.
These additions are inspired by Fortnite’s seasonal events and Axie Infinity’s NFT trading model, designed to increase player retention and economic activity (DappRadar, 2024).
Token Economics
Token Overview
Name: Suroi
Symbol: SUR
Total Supply: 1 billion SUR
Blockchain: Solana
Launch Platform: PUMP.fun (100% token supply issued via PUMP.fun)
Economic Model and Buyback Mechanism
SuroiFi’s token economic model balances deflation and incentives, drawing from PancakeSwap’s buyback-and-burn mechanism (PancakeSwap, 2024):
Buyback and Burn: 10% of in-game transaction fees (e.g., NFT purchases, tournament entries) are used to buy back and burn SUR tokens, reducing circulating supply and potentially increasing token value. Community rewards are provided entirely through this buyback mechanism, ensuring players earn SUR via gameplay and tournaments.
Staking Rewards: Players can stake SUR to earn an annual percentage yield (APR), initially set at 5-10%, adjustable based on market conditions.
Inflation Control: Balance token supply and demand through buyback-and-burn and limited reward issuance.
Governance Incentives: SUR holders participating in DAO voting receive additional rewards, encouraging long-term holding.
Token Uses:
In-Game Purchases: Players use SUR to buy skins, weapons, or other virtual items.
Tournament Entry Fees: Players pay SUR to join high-stake tournaments.
Staking Rewards: Staking SUR yields additional tokens or rare NFTs.
Governance Voting: SUR holders vote on game decisions via the DAO.
Economic Sustainability: The buyback-and-burn mechanism ensures token value stability while incentivizing player participation in gameplay and community activities. This model simplifies Axie Infinity’s dual-token system (AXS and SLP) into a single-token system to reduce complexity (DappRadar, 2024).
